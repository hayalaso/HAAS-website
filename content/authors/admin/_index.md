I'm an astrophysicist working at the [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.phys.psu.edu/) under my advisors Dr. Doug Cowen and Dr. Miguel Mostafa. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I'm involved in several projects related to high-energy astrophysics. I study high-energy gamma rays with the [HAWC](https://www.hawc-observatory.org/) Observatory, located in Mexico; mostly involved with the search of gamma-ray emission from large structures. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Another project involves the observation of high-energy neutrinos using the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) Observatory located in the South Pole. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

The third project is a multimessenger framework called [AMON](http://www.amon.psu.edu/), which looks for coincidences of events obtained by different detectors or observatories. This is a pioneer project in the search of multimessenger sources.

I earned my PhD at Michigan Technological University. My [thesis](https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/etdr/315/) was about observations of high-energy gamma-rays from the Northern _Fermi_ Bubble Region with the HAWC Observatory, advised by Dr. Petra Huentemeyer.

Besides science and research, I like spending my time by exercising, playing music or dancing.
