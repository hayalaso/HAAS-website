abstract = "We present a search for very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the Northern Fermi Bubble region using data collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov gamma-ray observatory. The size of the data set is 290 days. No significant excess is observed in the Northern Fermi Bubble region, so upper limits above 1 TeV are calculated. The upper limits are between 3x10$^{-7}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ and 4x10$^{-8}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. The upper limits disfavor a proton injection spectrum that extends beyond 100 TeV without being suppressed. They also disfavor a hadronic injection spectrum derived from neutrino measurements."
