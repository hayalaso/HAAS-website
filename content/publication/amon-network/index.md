abstract: " The Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) has been built with the purpose of enabling near real-time coincidence searches using data from leading multimessenger observatories and astronomical facilities. Its mission is to evoke discovery of multimessenger astrophysical sources, exploit these sources for purposes of astrophysics and fundamental physics, and explore multimessenger datasets for evidence of multimessenger source population AMON aims to promote the advancement of multimessenger astrophysics by allowing its participants to study the most energetic phenomena in the universe and to help answer some of the outstanding enigmas in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The main strength of AMON is its ability to combine and analyze sub-threshold data from different facilities. Such data cannot generally be used stand-alone to identify astrophysical sources. The analyses algorithms used by AMON can identify statistically significant coincidence candidates of multimessenger events, leading to the distribution of AMON alerts used by partner observatories for real-time follow-up that may identify and, potentially, confirm the reality of the multimessenger association. We present the science motivation, partner observatories, implementation and summary of the current status of the AMON project."
