abstract: "In the quest for high-energy neutrino sources, the Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Net- work (AMON) has implemented a new search by combining data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory and the Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environ- mental RESearch (ANTARES) neutrino telescope. Using the same analysis strategy as in a previous detector combination of HAWC and IceCube data, we perform a search for coincidences in HAWC and ANTARES events that are below the threshold for sending public alerts in each individual detector. Data were collected between July 2015 and February 2020 with a livetime of 4.39 years. Over this time period, 3 coincident events with an estimated false-alarm rate of <1 coincidence per year were found. This number is consistent with background expectations."
